        <p>Alternatively, you can go <a href="../index.html">back to the home page</a> if you'd rather try something else.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggs (as many as you want to boil)</li>
            <li>Water (enough to cover the eggs in a pot)</li>
            <li>A Stove (with the necessary utility to power it)</li>
            <li>A Pot (large enough to hold the eggs while leaving some space)</li>
            <li>A Slotted Spoon</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by gently placing your eggs in a pot.</li>
            <li>Pour enough water into the pot to generously cover the eggs.</li>
            <li>Bring the water to a rolling boil on the stove.</li>
            <li>Once boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Soft-Boiled Eggs</strong>: Leave them in the heat for 4-5 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Medium-Boiled Eggs</strong>: Leave them in the heat for 6-8 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Hard-Boiled Eggs</strong>: Leave them in the heat for 9-12 minutes.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once the time is up, remove your eggs from the pot using the slotted spoon and run cold water over them. This stops the cooking process and makes them easy to peel.</li>
            <li>Crack, peel, and enjoy your eggs. Congratulations! You have boiled eggs. </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
        <p>Cooking times can vary based on egg size and your personal preference for yolk "doneness". Don't be afraid to experiment and find out what works for you! Just be sure to not fall asleep or leave your eggs unattended while they're boiling.</p>
