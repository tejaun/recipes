        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Tap into your inner childhood (or simply repeat yesterday's breakfast) with this cereal that'll turn your milk into a raimbow. If you believe that breakfast should be simple, sugary, and <em>splendidly</em> colorful, this is the recipe for you.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, you can go <a href="../index.html">back to the home page</a> if you'd rather try something else.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A Spoon</li>
            <li>Kellogg's Froot Loops</li>
            <li>Milk (Preferably the white and dairy kind)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Retrieve your favorite bowl. If it is not clean, find it, clean it, and then prepare it for use. This is often an overlooked yet incredibly important step.</li>
            <li>Pour a generous serving of Froot Loops into the bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour a generous serving of milk into the same bowl, aiming for at least the halfway mark of the bowl.</li>
            <li>Grab the nearest spoon and begin eating.</li>
            <li>Once you're done eating, drink the remaining milk.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
        <p>We recommend not using a fork to eat this - or any cereal for that matter.</p>
